  o add subtree_check option
  o fix bug with sync/async option
  o nfs service was renamed to nfs-server for 2008.0
  o fix path for do_pkgs->ensure_is_installed : /sbin/rpc.statd

  interface is deleted(#28680)
- draknfs: fix missing use of gtkset (aginies)

0.9:
- allow drakroam to be run as user (#23771)
- do not allow drakconnect to be run as user anymore
- fix gateway detection for new ppp daemon (#27886)

0.8:
- prefer DNS variables over MS_DNS one in ifcfg files
  (should fix ppp ifcfg files and static net install)
- drakroam: rt73-firmware support (#29691)
- drakroam: do not detect network with empty ssid as configured
- drakroam: fix rf_kill detection for ipw3945 by checking it before
  interface presence
- drakroam: remove ipw3945d service support
- drakroam: reload ipw3945 module if no interface is present when the
  device is not rf-killed (fix missing interface is booting with rf-kill)
- drakroam: try to find wireless driver if unknown (fix rt61 detection)
- drakroam: rt61 firmware support

0.7:
- add missing tools: drakhosts, draknfs, draksambashare
  (thanks Titi for the hint)
- drakconnect: match PCI domain when looking up devices by MAC address
  (Titi)

- drakconnect: default to NEEDHOSTNAME=no
- drakroam: merge flags from configured wpa_supplicant networks in all
  matching scanned networks
- drakroam: detect ad-hoc networks when wpa_supplicant is used
- drakroam: pre-select detected wireless mode of the configured network
- drakroam: allow to configure ad-hoc networks with wpa_supplicant
- drakroam: write more settings in ifcfg files when wpa_supplicant is
  used
- drakroam: do not write Roaming WIRELESS_MODE anymore, ifup scripts
  will rely on WIRELESS_WPA_DRIVER
- drakroam: do not override AP address with "any" when parsing
  wpa_supplicant network list
- net_applet: start it using GNOME own autostart infrastructure
  (Frederic Crozat)
- net_applet: fix detection of running net_applet processes

0.6:
- use link detection delay for forcedeth and sky2 drivers (#28023)
- use ifplugd for forcedeth driver, it works fine (even if mii-tool does not handle it)
- override pcitable driver with detected network driver (useful to detect ndiswrapper)
- do not ask ndiswrapper firmware if already configured for selected device (#25968, #27850)
- drakroam: show window before wait message (fix window icon)
- drakroam: install required per-connection-type packages (useful for 3G connections)

0.5:
- add rt73 in the old rt2x00 list
