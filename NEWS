  (Frederic Crozat)
- net_applet: fix detection of running net_applet processes

- use link detection delay for forcedeth and sky2 drivers (#28023)
- use ifplugd for forcedeth driver, it works fine (even if mii-tool does not handle it)
- override pcitable driver with detected network driver (useful to detect ndiswrapper)
- do not ask ndiswrapper firmware if already configured for selected device (#25968, #27850)
